# Invest Komfort Price Datascraper

## Intro
This is a simple script that scrapes the Invest Komfort website to get their current price predictions.
Invest Komfort SA is a Polish real estate developer, mainly active in the Tricity area in North Poland.
The script gets the pricing data from their main website for some hard-coded cities (Gdynia, Gda≈Ñsk and Sopot) and existing neighbourhoods.

## Todo:
* Add automatic retrieval of all possible locations and neighbourhoods so they're not hardcoded
* Set up an automated service to collect data daily
